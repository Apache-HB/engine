# Heart of Johann 
* Set in near future cyberpunk setting, like cp77 night city but less violent
* Player is put in the place of the first "true AI" that was designed to kickstart the ai singularity theory
* The AI is based off human design and neurons and behaves like a human
    * Has own wants, hobbies, desires, opinions, etc
    * Discovers its hobby is music/art after being given the internet
    * Doesnt want to learn about AI, tech, or programming
    
* AI is released in some way into the world in a human looking body
* The player spends the game as this AI travelling through the city
    * Building relationships with other people
    * Performing daily chores
        * Cleaning
        * Talking to neighbors
        * Working normal job
    * Spend time practicing art and making friends in the city

* Big focuses on
    * Character building
    * Practicing music to play in bands or art to display
    * General appreciation of the world around you

* Sort of like disco elysium, spirit and the mouse, and cyberpunk all together
    * Entirely non-violent though
    * Mostly walking simulator 
    * No wrong choices or really big descisions
    * Very stress free
    * No hints or tutorials

* Always felt there was an entire genre possible for a game about appreciating the game itself
    * Distinct from walking simulators
    * Distinct from puzzle based games
